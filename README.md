# 2021 Design specs
Rebuilding/rebranding personal website: http://RichieBartlett.com/ 

I tend to favor dark backgrounds. Needs to be contrasted with the soft-white sections.  
This will be a multi-page site to direct users about me. Must be a responsive design that looks great on PC, iPad, and iPhones.
Project is to design seven pages as defined below.

Header Menu: 
- About
- Work
- Play
- Projects
- Tips [for donations and work payments via Crypto or PayPal]


Footer sections
- About
  - work
  - play
- Projects
  - Personal
  - Work
- Social (use icons at least 48px x 48px)
  - GitHub
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
- Legal
  - Privacy
  - ToS
  - Cookies


## Should have clearly defined header & footer sections. 
- [ ] A simple one-page layout is a good start. As long as the general layout is easy to replicate across pages.
- [ ] Page should load without requiring JavaScript to display. Please use CSS features instead of JavaScript. 
      (Good idea to design with JavaScript disabled in your browser.)
- [ ] Site should look the same on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. (Don't care about Microsoft IE/Edge.) 
- [ ] The FB/GitHub/external-link buttons should target a new tab for loading the page.
- [ ] Unless user scrolls down, footer can be hidden.
- [ ] IF you use javascript, please consolidate all code into a single JS file.
- [ ] Please consolidate all CSS into a single CSS file.
- [ ] Each page should not load more than 5 files total. 
      I will look at the network tab in Chrome to see what loads and how long it takes to load.
- [ ] Each page must load within 1500 milliseconds. (Assumes hosted on a CDN like AWS CloudFront.)
- [ ] I _like_ this site design: https://linusbohman.se/ . However, I'm open to other interesting designs.

``` 
I will upload my personal images to GitHub for use. 
See https://github.com/lorezyra/Richie2.com/tree/Dev/img folder.

```


## NOTES:  
: Please push all files directly to GitHub via a pull-request against the "dev" branch. [GitHub Dev branch](https://github.com/lorezyra/Richie2.com/tree/Dev)

: Try to keep the number of files to a minimum. 100 x 1k files is far slower than 1 x 100K file. 

: All images MUST be embedded into a single CSS file. [base64](https://www.base64-image.de/) 

: Any QR codes should use images generated by https://QRcode-monkey.com

: Please don't use copyrighted images. Free/open/pubic-domain images please. 

: Will keep contest open for at least 40 hours. (June 23rd)

: Font-Awesome is cool to use, but not required.

**Awarded freelancer will likely be hired for ongoing work at market rate for this site.**


## index.html:
This landing page will feature my photo covering a good portion of the viewable space (on PC & iPad) with animations that invite the user to select work or play. Should only animate if user changes mouse selection between either side of the screen (work / play).


## tips.html:
: Should model this page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorezyra/www.technocracy.works/Production/donate.html
: Will share the Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses later. I won't be using the old addresses for my personal site.


## about.html:
: Basic contents can be directly copied from the existing site @ RichieBartlett.com


## work.html:
: This page will represent my past CV/resume of sorts, but focused on highlighted companies and projects I've participated/lead.
: This page's background should be a little brighter than the index page.


## play.html:
: Display time I have with my twin sons, playing lego, writting fun code projects, & 
: This page's background should be a little brighter than the index page. Perhaps shift the hue to a more subtle color?


## projects.html:
: Here I will highlight my own personal projects such as LoreZyra.TV and Linspira (currently in redesign). I may also include LEGO projects.


## LEGAL.html:
: Here I will list all the standard disclaimers (copyrights, privacy, ToS, cookies, etc) for users of my site.
