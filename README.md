# 2021 Design specs
Rebuilding/rebranding personal website: http://RichieBartlett.com/ 

I tend to favor dark backgrounds. Needs to be contrasted with the soft-white sections.  
This will be a multi-page site to direct users about me. Must be a responsive design that looks great on PC, iPad, and iPhones.
Project is to design six pages as defined below.

A menu at the top for the following subsections: 
- About
- Work
  - History [LinkedIn]
- Play
- Projects
- Tips [for donations and work payments via Crypto or PayPal]


Footer should include social media links to GitHub, FB, Twitter, & Reddit.
Footer should also have the following sections
- About
- Projects
- Legal


## Should have clearly defined header & footer sections. 
- [ ] A simple one-page layout is a good start. As long as the general layout is easy to replicate across pages.
- [ ] Page should load without requiring JavaScript to display. Please use CSS features instead of JavaScript. [Good idea to design with JavaScript disabled in your browser.]
- [ ] Site should look the same on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. (Don't care about IE.) 
- [ ] The FB/GitHub/external-link buttons should target a new tab for loading the page.   

I _like_ this site design: https://linusbohman.se/

__I will upload my personal images to GitHub for use. See https://github.com/lorezyra/Richie2.com/tree/Dev/img folder.＿＿


## NOTES:  
: Final design can be a simple HTML page with embedded base64 images. Please push all files directly to GitHub via a pull-request against the "dev" branch. #https://github.com/lorezyra/Richie2.com

: Try to keep the number of files to a minimum. 100 x 1k files is slower than 1 x 100K file. 

: All images MUST be embedded into a single CSS file. (base64) 

: Any QR codes should use images generated by QRcode-monkey.com

: Please don't use copyrighted images. Free/open/pubic-domain images please. 

: Will keep contest open for at least 40 hours. (June 23rd)
