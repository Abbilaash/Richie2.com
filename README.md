## 2021 Design specs
Rebuilding/rebranding personal website: http://RichieBartlett.com/ 

I tend to favor dark backgrounds. Needs to be contrasted with the soft-white sections.  
Site will be a landing page to direct users about me. Must be a responsive design that looks great on PC, iPad, and iPhones.

A menu at the top for the following subsections: 
1) About
2) Work
3) Play
4) Projects
5) Tips [for donations and work payments via Crypto or PayPal]


Footer should include social media links to GitHub, FB, Twitter, & Reddit.
Footer should also have the following sections
1) About
2) Projects
3) Legal

Should have clearly defined header & footer sections.  
A simple one-page site is a good start. As long as the general layout is easy to replicate across pages.

<> Page should load without requiring JavaScript to display. Please use CSS features instead of JavaScript.   

++ Site should look the same on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. (Don't care about IE.) 
++ The FB/GitHub/external-link buttons should target a new tab for loading the page.   


NOTES:  
** Final design can be a simple HTML page with embedded base64 images. (Zipped up file is acceptable.) 
** Try to keep the number of files to a minimum. 100 x 1k files is slower than 1 x 100K file.  
** (Once Awarded) Will ask all images to be embedded into a single CSS file. (base64) 
** Any QR codes should use images generated by QRcode-monkey.com
** Please don't use copyrighted images. Free/open/pubic-domain images please. 
*** Will keep contest open for at least 40 hours. (June 23rd)
+++ Awarded freelancer will likely be hired for ongoing work at market rate.
